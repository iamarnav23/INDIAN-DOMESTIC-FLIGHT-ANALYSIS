# Indian Domestic Flight Analysis 

## Project Objective

This project performs an in-depth analysis of the Indian domestic flight market using a dataset . The primary goal was to complete an end-to-end data analytics project, including:
* Sourcing and cleaning the data.
* Setting up a relational database and designing a schema.
* Engineering an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline.
* Performing exploratory data analysis using advanced SQL queries.
* Visualizing the findings in an interactive dashboard.

## Tools & Technologies

* **Database:** PostgreSQL
* **Database GUI:** pgAdmin 4
* **ETL & Data Cleaning:** Python (with Pandas & SQLAlchemy)
* **Data Visualization:** Tableau Public

## Project Workflow

The project began by sourcing a Indian domestic flight dataset from Kaggle. A PostgreSQL database was set up, and a Python script using Pandas and SQLAlchemy was developed to perform the ETL processâ€”reading, cleaning, and loading the data. Key business questions were then answered by writing and executing advanced SQL queries in pgAdmin. Finally, these insights were presented by connecting Tableau to the database to build a comprehensive, interactive dashboard.

## Key Insights

* **Busiest Airline:** Jet Airways had the highest volume of flights in this dataset, closely followed by IndiGo and Air India.
* **Price Distribution:** The analysis revealed a significant variation in average ticket prices among different airlines, with some carriers specializing in premium routes.
* **Popular Routes:** The routes connecting major metro cities like Delhi, Mumbai, and Bengaluru were the busiest.
* **Impact of Stops:** Non-stop flights were generally more expensive than connecting flights, showing a clear trade-off between cost and convenience.
